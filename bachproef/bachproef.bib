This study aims to, (1) develop a detailed criteria based on selected thematic areas and associated focus areas, to evaluate the key attributes of whole building environmental life cycle assessment software tools (WBELCA-STs), (2) analyze the distinctive abilities and areas for improvement of the selected software tools (STs) with respect to the key attributes, (3) categorize the selected STs according to their individual performances to facilitate ST selection, to match the user requirements. WBELCA-STs currently used were identified by reviewing published scientific literature (2001–2021). Nine STs were shortlisted based on the number of results returned during the literature search. A comprehensive evaluation criterion based on five themes was developed and shortlisted nine STs were evaluated against the key attributes. This study adds to the existing knowledge on whole building environmental life cycle assessment by identifying the key areas that strengthen the comprehensiveness and user-friendliness of WBELCA-STs, while promoting sustainable design in all life cycle stages. Further the strengths and areas for improvement of the STs were identified to categorize them. Priorities needed to be considered in selecting a suitable ST for building assessment projects were revealed. There is a need in developing, maintaining and updating more databases and STs to popularize building environmental sustainability assessments in many regions of the world, including Asia.},

  abstract     = {Abstract This article presents one part of a wider study, performed at the Department of library and information science and book studies (LIS \& BS) at the University of Ljubljana (UL). The study investigated the perceptions of user friendliness of information-retrieval systems (IRS) and the role of individual characteristics of users in these perceptions. Based on an expert study, a user study with 61 postgraduate students of the UL was performed. Three interfaces of e-journals were studied: Science Direct, Proquest Direct, and Ebsco Host. Questionnaires and observations were used for data collection. The users'perceptions of user friendliness and of importance of auxiliary functions were investigated. Also, the connections between these perceptions and the users'individual characteristics were identified. Three sets of individual characteristics were included: approaches to studying, thinking styles, and hemisphere leanings. In connection with the dimensions of individual characteristics, very different perceptions of user friendliness were expressed. Some dimensions of individual characteristics were also found to be connected to the users'academic areas. It is shown that participants from different academic areas have different requirements and perceptions of user friendliness. The results of the study are relevant for the design of the user interfaces of disciplinary IR systems. They also have implications for other areas, for example, user education and training.}
